# AGENTS.md - Evaluation

> **IMPORTANT**: Read the root [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) first for repo-wide rules.

## Maintenance Contract

- This file is a living document for the evaluation framework.
- Update this file in the same PR when adding new evaluators, metrics, or evaluation pipelines.

## Read Order

1. Read the root [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) for repo-wide rules, commands, and routing.
2. Read this file for evaluation-specific guidance.

## Overview

Offline evaluation framework for assessing agent response quality, hallucination, containment, tone consistency, and token efficiency. Supports adversarial testing, shadow testing, and continuous improvement metrics.

| Shadow testing | `@app/evaluation/shadow.py` | Shadow mode evaluation against production |
| Metrics | `@app/evaluation/metrics.py` | Evaluation metrics (accuracy, relevance, etc.) |
| Hallucination detection | `@app/evaluation/hallucination.py` | LLM-based hallucination detection |
| Tone consistency | `@app/evaluation/tone_consistency.py` | Tone and style consistency evaluation |
| Baseline comparison | `@app/evaluation/baseline.py` | Baseline model comparison |

| Deterministic workflow evaluation | `@app/evaluation/offline.py` | Provider-free objective T21 contract evaluation |

## Commands

```bash
# Run evaluation module tests
uv run pytest tests/evaluation/

# Run the canonical provider-free workflow evaluation
uv run python -m app.evaluation.offline --dataset data/offline_workflow_eval_v1.jsonl
```

## Code Style

General Python rules are defined in the root `AGENTS.md`. Evaluation-specific conventions:

- **Type hints**: All metric functions and evaluation methods must be fully typed.
- **Immutability**: Evaluation datasets should be treated as immutable; create new versions rather than modifying existing ones.
- **Reproducibility**: Fix random seeds and document LLM model versions for reproducible evaluation results.

## Testing Patterns

- Mock LLM calls in evaluation tests to avoid non-determinism.
- Use synthetic datasets for unit tests; reserve real data for integration tests.
- Test each metric independently with known inputs/outputs.
- Verify pipeline orchestration with mocked components.

## Conventions

- **Metric range**: All metrics should return scores in the range [0, 1] where 1 is optimal.
- **Hallucination detection**: Binary scoring (0.0 or 1.0); target false positive rate ≤ 0.05.
- **Containment check**: Verify responses are contained within retrieved context; flag violations.
- **Dataset versioning**: Version evaluation datasets to track changes over time.
- **Model routes**: Evaluation and shadow runners select configured `evaluation`, `safety`, or
  `shadow` route aliases; evaluation code must not construct provider clients or hard-code models.
- **Evaluation boundary**: The deterministic workflow dataset measures objective routing, policy,
  isolation, lifecycle, and failure behavior. It must not be presented as live-model linguistic
  quality evidence.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Evaluating on training data**: Never evaluate on data used for prompt engineering or fine-tuning.
- **Single-metric evaluation**: Use multiple complementary metrics for robust assessment.
- **Ignoring edge cases**: Include adversarial and edge cases in evaluation datasets.
