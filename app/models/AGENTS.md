# AGENTS.md - Models

> **IMPORTANT**: Read the root [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) first for repo-wide rules.

## Maintenance Contract

- This file is a living document for data models.
- Update this file in the same PR when adding new models or changing model conventions.

## Read Order

1. Read the root [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) for repo-wide rules, commands, and routing.
2. Read this file for model-specific guidance.

## Overview

SQLModel/Pydantic data models for database entities and agent state. Defines the data layer used by services, tools, and memory managers.

## Commands

```bash
# Run model tests
uv run pytest tests/models/
```

## Code Style

General Python rules are defined in the root `AGENTS.md`. Model-specific conventions:

- **Type hints**: All model fields must have explicit type annotations.
- **Validation**: Use Pydantic validators for complex field validation.
- **Relationships**: Use SQLModel relationship fields with explicit back-populates.
- **Defaults**: Provide sensible defaults for optional fields.

## Testing Patterns

- Test model validation with valid and invalid data.
- Verify relationship cascading behavior.
- Test `make_agent_state()` factory with various configurations.

## Conventions

- **Table names**: Use plural snake_case for table names (e.g., `users`, `orders`).
- **Tenant scope**: Every platform-owned table must inherit `TenantScopedModel`; tenant-local natural keys must use composite unique constraints including `tenant_id`.
- **Primary keys**: Use auto-incrementing integers for primary keys.
- **Timestamps**: Include `created_at` and `updated_at` on all models.
- **Soft deletes**: Use `is_deleted` flag rather than hard deletion where appropriate.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Business logic in models**: Keep models as data containers; no business logic.
- **Circular imports**: Avoid circular imports between model files.
- **Missing indexes**: Add database indexes on frequently queried fields.
