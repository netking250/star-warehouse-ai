# AGENTS.md - Tests

> **IMPORTANT**: Read the root [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) first for repo-wide rules, commands, and routing.

## Maintenance Contract

- `AGENTS.md` is a living document.
- Update this file in the same PR when test conventions, fixtures, or patterns materially change.
- Keep this file focused on test-specific guidance; do not duplicate root-level rules.

## Read Order

1. Read the root [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) for repo-wide rules, commands, and routing.
2. Read this file for test-specific conventions and patterns.
3. For fixture details, read [`@tests/conftest.py`](conftest.py) and [`@tests/_llm.py`](_llm.py).

## Overview

Backend test suite using pytest + pytest-asyncio with a flat directory structure (not strictly mirroring `app/` subpackages).

## Code Style

General Python rules are defined in the root `AGENTS.md`. Test-specific conventions:

- **Descriptive naming**: Use `test_<module>_<scenario>_<expected_outcome>` for all test functions.
- **Fixture reuse**: Prefer session-scoped fixtures from `@tests/conftest.py` over recreating setup per test.
- **Minimal mocks**: Use helper functions in `@tests/_llm.py` and `@tests/_agents.py` to construct mocks; avoid hardcoding large JSON blobs in tests.
- **No `time.sleep`**: Never use `time.sleep` to wait for async results. Use `asyncio.wait_for` or proper mocking instead.

## Testing Patterns

- **Bug-fix TDD**: Every bug fix must start with a failing reproduction test. Confirm the test fails before applying the fix.
- **Async tests**: All async tests must be decorated with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`.
- **State factory**: Use `make_agent_state()` from `@app/models/state.py` to construct agent state; avoid assembling state objects inline across multiple tests.
- **LLM mocking**: Use helpers in `@tests/_llm.py` to construct mock responses. Prefer real LLM tests for components that directly invoke LLMs; use mocks for error handling, edge cases, batch operations, and components that do not directly call LLMs.
- **External service isolation**: Unit tests should not call database, Redis, Qdrant, or SMS gateways directly. Integration tests may access the test DB in controlled environments.
- **Real LLM tests**: Mark tests that require a real LLM with `@pytest.mark.requires_llm`. These tests skip automatically when `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` is not configured. Use the `real_llm` fixture from `@tests/conftest.py` for real LLM instances.
- **Coverage gate**: CI enforces `pytest --cov=app --cov-fail-under=75`. Do not lower the threshold; add tests for uncovered code instead.

## Conventions

- **Flat structure**: Tests do not strictly mirror `app/` subpackage paths.
- **Naming**: Descriptive test names that convey scenario and expected outcome.
- **Fixture reuse**: Use session-scoped fixtures from `@tests/conftest.py` to avoid repeated DB connection overhead.
- **Database isolation**: Import `tests._db_config` before any `app` module. Destructive setup is allowed only when `POSTGRES_DB` starts with `test_`.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Monolithic test files**: Large test files with many test methods should be split by concern (e.g., split by feature or test type rather than accumulating in a single file).
- **Repeated mock state blocks**: Extract repeated mock state construction into fixtures or helper functions in `@tests/_agents.py`.
- **`time.sleep` in tests**: Never use `time.sleep` for async results; use proper async waiting or mocking.
- **Skipping coverage**: Do not skip coverage checks locally; when uncovered code is found, add tests rather than lowering thresholds.
